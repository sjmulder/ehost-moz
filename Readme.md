Adds a widget and context menu item to upload images to eHo.st. (See: http://eho.st)

New in version 1.1:

* Added an Add-on Bar widget that automatically picks the page’s main image and uploads it to eHo.st.

* The “Upload Image to eHo.st” context menu now also appears page-wide on supported sites such as imgur, Flickr, yFrog, TwitPic and ImageShack.
