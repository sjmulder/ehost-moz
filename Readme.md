eHo.st is a community-owned image hosting service. This plugin lets you upload images directly from a widget and the context (right-click) menu on any web page.

New in version 1.1:

* Added an Add-on Bar widget that automatically picks the page’s main image and uploads it to eHo.st.

* The “Upload Image to eHo.st” context menu now also appears page-wide on supported sites such as imgur, Flickr, yFrog, TwitPic and ImageShack.

Also available for [Safari](http://github.com/sjmulder/ehost-safari) and [Opera](http://github.com/sjmulder/ehost-opera). Written by Sijmen Mulder under the BSD licence.
